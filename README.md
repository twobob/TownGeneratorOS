# Medieval Fantasy City Generator
This is a remangling of Medieval Fantasy City Generator by @watabou
The repository now ships only browser-ready JavaScript and HTML. To run the generator locally, simply open `index.html` in a modern browser (or serve the repository through any static file server) and the city generator will launch entirely on the client. Demo: https://twobob.github.io/TownGeneratorOS
