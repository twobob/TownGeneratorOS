# Medieval Fantasy City Generator
This is the source code of the [Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator/) (also available [here](http://fantasycities.watabou.ru/?size=15&seed=682063530)). It lacks some of the latest features, namely waterbodies, options UI and some smaller ones. Maybe I'll update it later.

The repository now ships only browser-ready JavaScript and HTML. To run the generator locally, simply open `index.html` in a modern browser (or serve the repository through any static file server) and the city generator will launch entirely on the client—no Haxe toolchain or binary assets are required.
